# Storyteller

Storyteller is a very (very!) slow WIP that will eventually, hopefully, become a multi-system Discord dice bot and character manager for World of Darkness and Chronicles of Darkness games.

In the meantime, check out [[Tzimisce]](https://tzimisce.app) for a basic X20 Wod/CofD dice bot. Check out [Inconnu](https://inconnu.app) for a fully-featured V5 dice bot and character manager.
